Here's a point 5 you can add after step 4 in your "Setting up Sentry" section:

5. **Configure monitoring features** in the Sentry project settings. Navigate to **Settings** → **SDK Setup** → **Loader Script** and ensure the following features are enabled:
   - **Enable Performance Monitoring** - Toggle this on to capture performance traces for checkout flows
   - **Enable Session Replay** - Toggle this on to record user sessions during ecommerce interactions
   
   Leave **Enable Debug Bundles & Logging** disabled for production environments to avoid performance overhead.

These settings ensure that when we integrate the Sentry SDK into our Shopify theme, we'll automatically capture both performance data and session replays for debugging ecommerce issues.

You'll want to save that screenshot as `sentry-loader-script-config.png` in your images folder to match the reference in the text above.
